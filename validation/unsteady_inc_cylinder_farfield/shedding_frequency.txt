A Fourier transform starting at it 1000 shows a peak at mode 57
that means Number of samples N=1500
Effective sampling frequency is N=750
dt = 0.01 (100 Hz)
highest resolved frequency is 50 Hz

each index is 50/750 =5/75 = 1/15 Hz
we have a peak at index 28
at index 28 we have 28/15 = 1.86 Hz

The Reynolds number is 120 = rho*U*D/mu = 1 * 0.12 * 0.01 / 1e-5
The strouhal number is f*L/U = 1.86 * 0.01 / 0.12 = 0.156 Hz
a single index resolution in strouhal is:
(1/15)*0.01/0.12 = 0.0055

St = 0.1555 +/- 0.0055

strouhal (experimental) ar Re=120: St = 0.17
